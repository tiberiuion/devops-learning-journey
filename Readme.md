# DevOps and Cybersecurity Learning Journey

This repository documents my journey into DevOps and cybersecurity, focusing on practical, hands-on learning and structured progress tracking. Each stage of the curriculum builds foundational knowledge, introduces tools, and includes exercises to reinforce concepts.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized by stages, topics, and weeks:

```

## Workflow

This section outlines the steps I follow for learning and documenting progress.
1. Plan and Organize
   - Review the weekly tasks and objectives from the curriculum.
   - Create a folder for the week's work under the appropriate stage/topic.
   - Update exercises.md with a bullet-point list of tasks for the week.
1. Learn and Practice
   - Work through the topics listed in the curriculum using the suggested resources.
   - Take notes as I learn:
     - Write concepts, commands, and examples in notes.md.
     - Include troubleshooting steps for challenges faced.
2. Build and Test
   - Complete practice exercises and scripts:
     - Save scripts and output files in the same topic folder.
     - Test scripts locally using Docker or the native Linux environment.
3. Document Progress
  - Record daily logs in exercises.md:
  - Note tasks completed, issues faced, and lessons learned.
  - At the end of the week, write a summary in exercises.md with:
  - What was learned.
  - Completed projects or scripts.
  - Track and Commit
4. Track progress using branches:
   - Each topic has its own branch.
     - Example: stage-1/linux-basics.
     - Commit changes regularly with meaningful messages:
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Day 1: Complete navigation tasks"
    git push origin stage-1/linux-basics
    ```
